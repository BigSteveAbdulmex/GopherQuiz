What is an interface in Go?,A type that specifies a set of methods that a type must implement,A concrete type that holds data,A keyword used for defining functions,A way to create global variables,1
How do you define an interface in Go?,type InterfaceName interface { MethodSignature1; MethodSignature2 },interface InterfaceName { MethodSignature1; MethodSignature2 },type InterfaceName struct { MethodSignature1; MethodSignature2 },interface InterfaceName struct { MethodSignature1; MethodSignature2 },1
What is a method signature in an interface?,The name and parameter list (including types) and return types of a method,Only the name of the method,Only the parameter types,Only the return types,1
How does a type indicate that it implements an interface in Go?,By having methods with the same names and signatures as those in the interface,By explicitly declaring that it implements the interface using a keyword,Using a special syntax in the type definition,It's not possible in Go,1
What is an empty interface in Go?,`interface{}` - an interface with no methods,An interface that cannot be implemented,An interface used for nil values,An interface that can hold any type,1
What is the benefit of using empty interfaces?,It allows functions to accept values of any type,It enforces strict type checking,It improves performance,It simplifies code,1
What is an interface value in Go?,A value that holds a concrete value and its dynamic type,A pointer to an interface,A special type of nil value,A string representation of the interface,1
What is the dynamic type of an interface value?,The actual concrete type held by the interface value at runtime,The interface type itself,Always `interface{}`,The underlying type of the methods in the interface,1
What is a type assertion in Go?,An operation to extract the underlying concrete value from an interface value,A way to check if a type implements an interface,A way to convert between different interface types,A way to define a new type,1
What happens if a type assertion to a specific type fails (and the comma-ok idiom is not used)?,It returns the zero value of the target type,It causes a runtime panic,It returns nil,It returns an error,2
What keyword is used to start a type switch in Go?,switch i.(type) {,type switch i {,switch type of i {,typeof switch i {,1
What is the `default` case in a type switch?,The case that is executed if none of the other type cases match,The case for the empty interface,The case for nil values,The case for the interface type itself,1
Why are interfaces useful in Go?,They enable polymorphism and allow for writing more generic and flexible code,They improve performance,They simplify error handling,They are required for concurrency,1
